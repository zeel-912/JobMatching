Volunteer Orange County Makos, Defensive Coordinator, Fullerton, CA The opportunity to coach opened up my eyes to the benefits of encouragement and leading thru adversity. The team was wrought with internal struggles because of the lack of trust in team ownership. As the Defensive Coordinator, I was challenged to convince the defensive players to trust the work ethic of the offensive players and to verbally encourage their play. In 2001, we had a head coach and ownership change and with 95% of the previous team returning, we reshaped expectations and built confidence thru competition. We finished the year as CFL Champions. AYSO, Coach, Long Beach, CA Coaching young children has helped me to simplify instructions, gauge motivation in each child and tailor my approach to build their confidence. These key points, I learned coaching young and older athletes crosses over to employees. People need consistent and helpful direction to improve their performance and ability to hone their craft. Athletes and employees look to their coach or boss for leadership and motivation to help them reach their full potential.\n",

Other Accomplishments Last year I was asked to administer the GATE after school program. Together, the GATE identified students and I, created a school newspaper. We named it the Jr Journal and invented five topics that would be in every issue. I helped create an outline and template that our reporters could follow and eventually do independently. Each student chose a different topic every month and would either interview or research to write an article for that section. They would then write a rough draft, that I would edit, and then they would type the final draft and put it into the newspaper template. Students would also have a chance to find graphics or take pictures that fit their topic. It turned out great and we were able to publish four issues. This will be our second year. This was a great accomplishment for me as an educator, because I love to write and was in my school newspaper in High School. I had the chance to share a passion of mine and see students enjoy coming in after school and put their advanced brains to work. It was such a great experience and can't wait to have that again this year.\n",

They have two little boys. Ryan (age 2) and Nathan (age 5) On the way to work for Kelly, she would drop off Nathan at pre-school. I would watch/care for Ryan until 11:30, then I got him ready to get in the car to go pick up big brother from school on Bellevue way. When we got back from picking up Nathan, I would feed them lunch. Made them dinner. Made sure they had good hygiene. They weren't allowed much screen time (television or online games, etc.) so we mostly did critical thinking activities such as reading and writing and art. Played active games, took them to parks in Seattle, North Bend, Bellevue, and Issaquah. Put the boys to sleep at night. Watched over their house & fed their cat when they went on long vacations.
